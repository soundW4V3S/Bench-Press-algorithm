# Bench-Press-algorithm
A program that calculates how to reach a target bench press weight goal, given a list of numbers entered by the user.

Created over the span of roughly a day. I realize there could be floating-point precision issues, but generally, this works for most cases.

Thanks for viewing/using!


# Version 1.1:

Added features I thought of while using this program at the gym.
A lot of the time, we don't have a certain weight target goal in mind, we just say;
"Rack on a 45 and a 5", or something like that

So, with this new version, I made it so there is a feature to automatically calculate how much you're racking,
given input weight numbers.

That, and I've also changed some input logic so typing generally takes less overall time, while still trying
my best to keep string/number inputting safe.


-- Thank you again for using! May come with more updates, but this builds on things I discovered while using the base algorithm by itself.
